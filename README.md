Objective
The objective of this project is to evaluate and compare the performance of various supervised learning algorithms on the Breast Cancer dataset. The key steps in this process include:

Loading and preprocessing the dataset.

Implementing and training five different classification models.

Comparing the models' performance and identifying the best model.

Dataset
The dataset used is the Breast Cancer dataset from the sklearn library. This dataset contains 30 features describing cell properties, such as texture and smoothness, used to classify whether the cancer is malignant or benign.

Number of instances: 569

Number of features: 30

Target: 0 = Benign, 1 = Malignant

Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were performed on the dataset:

Feature Scaling: Standardization of features using StandardScaler to ensure all features have zero mean and unit variance. This step is crucial for algorithms that depend on distance calculations, like k-NN and SVM.

Data Splitting: The dataset was split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets using train_test_split to evaluate the models' performance on unseen data.

No Missing Values: The dataset does not contain any missing values, so no imputation was required.

Implemented Classification Algorithms
The following five classification algorithms were implemented and evaluated:

Logistic Regression: A linear model that predicts probabilities and works well for binary classification tasks. It assumes a linear relationship between features and the target.

Decision Tree Classifier: A non-linear model that splits the data based on feature values to make decisions. It's easy to interpret but can overfit on complex data.

Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting by averaging the results of many trees.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful algorithm that finds the hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes. SVM is effective for both linear and non-linear classification problems.

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): A simple instance-based learning algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.

Model Performance Comparison
The following accuracy scores were obtained after training each model and evaluating them on the test set:

Model	Accuracy
Logistic Regression	0.982456
Random Forest	0.970760
SVM	0.970760
k-NN	0.959064
Decision Tree	0.941520
Best Performing Model: Logistic Regression with an accuracy of 98.25%.
Worst Performing Model: Decision Tree with an accuracy of 94.15%.

Worst Performing Model: Decision Tree with an accuracy of 94.15%.

Conclusion
Logistic Regression performed the best, making it the most suitable model for this dataset based on the accuracy.

Decision Tree, while a powerful and interpretable model, performed the worst due to its susceptibility to overfitting, especially on small datasets.

This project highlights the importance of choosing the right machine learning model and preprocessing steps to achieve the best results. Logistic Regression and ensemble methods like Random Forest and SVM performed the best in this case.
